## ðŸ’» Projects

- **[Redbus-Data-Scraping-and-Streamlit-App](https://github.com/MANISHYASH/Redbus-Data-Scraping-and-Streamlit-App))**  
    The Redbus Data Scraping Project focuses on automating the extraction of bus booking information from the Redbus website using Selenium. The project involves collecting data such as bus timings, ticket       prices, operator names, and seat availability, and then storing this data in a structured format for analysis. Additionally, a Streamlit application is developed to enable dynamic filtering and visualization of     the scraped data, allowing users to search and filter buses by location, price, and time in real-time.

  Key components:
  ---------------

  - Web Scraping: Used Selenium to scrape real-time data from Redbus.
  - Data Storage: Stored the scraped data in a MySQL database for easy retrieval.
  - Streamlit App: Created an interactive dashboard with dynamic filtering to view and analyze bus options based on various criteria.
  
This project demonstrates proficiency in web scraping, data processing, and building user-friendly interfaces for data exploration.

- **[DataSpark-Illuminating-Insights-for-Global-Electronics](https://github.com/MANISHYASH/DataSpark-Illuminating-Insights-for-Global-Electronics)**  
    The DataSpark project focuses on retail analytics in the electronics industry. The goal is to analyze global sales data, customer behavior, and store performance to uncover actionable insights. Using advanced data processing techniques, SQL queries, and Power BI visualizations, this project provides a comprehensive view of the business's performance across different regions and product categories.

    Key features:
  --------------

  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Cleaned and merged datasets including sales, customers, products, stores, and exchange rates.
  - SQL Queries: Created SQL queries to extract insights like top-selling products, average order value, and sales by store.
  - Power BI Dashboard: Built interactive dashboards to visualize trends in sales, customer demographics, and store operations.
  - 
This project highlights expertise in data management, business intelligence, and visualization to support strategic decision-making.

- **[Car_Dheko-Used_Car_Price_Prediction](https://github.com/MANISHYASH/Car_Dheko-Used_Car_Price_Prediction)**  
     The Car Price Prediction Project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the prices of cars based on various features, such as make, model, year, mileage, and engine specifications. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the project focuses on delivering accurate price predictions to assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

  Key components:
  ---------------

  - Data Processing: Cleaned and transformed the dataset, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and encoding categorical variables.
  - Model Development: Implemented multiple regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost, to identify the best-performing model based on accuracy and mean squared error.
  - Deployment: Created a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input car features and receive real-time price predictions.
    
This project showcases skills in data analysis, machine learning, and web application development, providing valuable insights into the automotive market.

- **[Microsoft-Classifying_Cybersecurity_Incidents]([https://github.com/MANISHYASH/Car_Dheko-Used_Car_Price_Prediction](https://github.com/MANISHYASH/Microsoft-Classifying_Cybersecurity_Incidents))**
The Microsoft-Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents Project focuses on identifying fraudulent transactions using machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques. The objective is to develop a model that effectively detects suspicious activities, helping to enhance security in financial systems.

  Key components:
  ---------------
  
  - Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered historical transaction data and performed data cleaning, focusing on relevant features to indicate potential fraud. This included handling missing values and           outliers.
  - Model Development: Utilized various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to train and evaluate models for detecting fraudulent transactions. The         project aimed to achieve high accuracy and minimize false positives.
  - Analysis and Insights: Analyzed the performance of different models and provided insights into the patterns associated with fraudulent transactions, contributing to improved understanding and prevention          strategies.
     
- **Multilingual-storyteller([[https://github.com/MANISHYASH/Car_Dheko-Used_Car_Price_Prediction](https://github.com/MANISHYASH/multilingual-storyteller)]**
    The Multilingual Storyteller Project aims to create an interactive platform that generates and shares stories in multiple languages, fostering cultural exchange and language learning. By leveraging natural       language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, this project enhances the accessibility of storytelling across different linguistic backgrounds.

  Key components:
  ---------------

  - Content Generation: Developed algorithms to create engaging stories in various languages, incorporating elements like plot, characters, and themes that resonate with diverse audiences.
  - Language Support: Implemented translation capabilities to ensure accurate and context-aware translations, allowing users to enjoy stories in their preferred language.
  - User Interaction: Designed a user-friendly interface that enables users to select languages, customize story elements, and share their favorite tales with others.

This project highlights skills in natural language processing, machine learning, and cultural engagement, promoting storytelling as a universal form of expression.
